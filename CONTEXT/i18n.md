# Internationalization Notes — Louhen Landing

---

## Static Locales (Locked)

- Supported locales: `en`, `de`, `fr`, `nl`, `it` to cover the DE launch programme and nearby expansion markets.
- Locale metadata (labels, regions, `hrefLang`) lives in `lib/i18n/locales.ts` and must stay in sync with message bundles.

## Default-Locale SSR (Locked)

- `next-intl` runs with `localePrefix = "always"`; even the default locale renders under `/en-de/...` to avoid fallback gaps.
- Middleware upgrades bare routes (`/`, `/method`, `/en`, `/de`) to the canonical prefixed equivalents and short-circuits already-localised paths.
- Loopback hosts bypass HTTPS/HSTS while retaining all other security headers so automation (Lighthouse, Playwright) remains green.

## Launch Assumptions (Locked)

- Launch market is Germany with English-first copy tuned for DE parents; provide localized German copy for `/de-de/*`.
- No hardcoded UI strings; fetch messages from namespace files (e.g., `method`, `waitlist`, `common`) to guarantee translation parity.
- Copy decks must accommodate DE string length; QA hero and CTA layouts at 320px width for each locale.

## Namespace: `method`

- Keys include `seo.*`, `a11y.skipToCta`, hero/trust/pillar/how/testimonial/founder/faq structures, and `cta.final`.
- Analytics events respect locale context but keep shared naming (`method_*`) for aggregation.
- Update localization files via PR with reviewer from Marketing or Localization before marking ready.
