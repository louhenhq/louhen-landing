# Decision Log â€” Louhen Landing

This file tracks **locked decisions** (do not change without explicit proposal) and the **history of changes**.  
It ensures Codex and contributors never undo critical choices or repeat past discussions.

## Locked Decisions

- **Framework**: Next.js App Router with TypeScript + Tailwind.  
- **Hosting**: Vercel.  
- **Data writes**: Firebase Admin SDK (server-side only).  
- **Form security**: hCaptcha required on public submissions.  
- **Emails**: Resend for transactional flows (after domain verification).  
- **Release management**: semantic-release with Conventional Commits.  
- **Testing**: Playwright E2E + Lighthouse CI.  
- **Payments**: Adyen is company-wide provider (not yet used here).  
- **i18n**: next-intl scaffolding; ready for Locize + DeepL later.  
- **Security baseline**: no client-side secrets; GDPR-first handling of PII.
- **Environment & Domains locked**: Canonical host `www.louhen.app` (production). Apex `louhen.app` issues 301 redirect to `www.louhen.app`. Preview domain `staging.louhen.app` (maps to `staging` branch). Wildcard previews `*.staging.louhen.app` CNAME to `cname.vercel-dns.com` (DNS only). Deployment Protection does not cover custom production domains without Vercel Business; mitigation is keeping production DNS dark until launch.
