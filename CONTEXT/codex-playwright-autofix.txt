You are Codex for the louhen-landing repo.

Before any change, read /CONTEXT/decision_log.md and abide by locked decisions.
Use PLAN → DIFF → VALIDATE → REVERT.

Scope:
- Fix Playwright e2e failures using the latest failure brief (playwright-failures.md).
- Prefer test fixes (selectors, wait helpers, consent/auth handling, copy drift).
- Only touch runtime if the contract is documented as changed.
- Keep diffs surgical; no new deps; keep build step public-only; e2e may use dummy server envs already present in CI.

Validation:
- Run: npm run lint && npm run build && npm run test
- Then re-run the failing e2e files first (from the brief).
- If still red, update the brief summary and stop (do not loop endlessly).

Safety:
- Do not modify secrets or CI build envs.
- Do not change product copy just to satisfy tests (fix tests to be resilient).
