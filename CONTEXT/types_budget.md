# TypeScript Expectation Budget

Log every temporary `@ts-expect-error`, rule suppression, or intentional `any` introduced while piloting strict mode. Each entry must include a ticket or backlog reference plus the slice that will remove it.

| Location (file:line) | Reason | Owner | Removal Slice / Issue |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| _None yet_ | — | — | — |

Rules:
- Add rows when you introduce an expectation; do **not** merge without updating this table.
- Link to a GitHub issue or backlog item under “Removal Slice / Issue”.
- Remove the row once the expectation is deleted and the strict build passes without it.
