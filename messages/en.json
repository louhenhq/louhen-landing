Louhen brings precise measurements, LouhenFit coverage, and curated looks so every pair feels like it was made for your child.",

    "headline": "Our story began with twins",
    "p1": "When our twin boys, Louis and Henry, took their first steps, we wanted to find them the perfect shoes. A physiotherapist recommended a small local store, and while the owners were kind, the experience was stressful: long waits with impatient kids, just two shoe options, and only basic measurements of length and width.",
    "p2": "That day we realized how much guesswork parents face when shopping for children’s shoes. We thought: there must be a better way — one that makes fit effortless and choice inspiring.",
    "p3": "That’s why we built Louhen: an app designed by parents, for parents — where every recommendation feels thoughtfully tailored, healthy feet are always the priority, and shopping is calm instead of chaotic. To honor our beginnings, we created the Twins Welcome Voucher: 5% off every order for twin parents.",
