A physiotherapist recommended a small local store, and while the owners were kind, the experience was stressful: long waits with impatient kids, just two shoe options, and only basic measurements of length and width.",
    "p2": "That day we realized how much guesswork parents face when shopping for children‚Äôs shoes. We thought: there must be a better way ‚Äî one that makes fit effortless and choice inspiring.",
    "p3": "That‚Äôs why we built Louhen: an app designed by parents, for parents ‚Äî where every recommendation feels thoughtfully tailored, healthy feet are always the priority, and shopping is calm instead of chaotic. To honor our beginnings, we created the Twins Welcome Voucher: 5% off every order for twin parents.",
