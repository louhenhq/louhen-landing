    "title": "Why we started Louhen",
    "body": "Our twins needed their first shoes, but the store had long queues, rushed fittings, and only length and width to go by. We wanted parents to know how a shoe will feel before checkout, to compare styles side-by-side, and to shop when it fits their schedule. Louhen brings precise measurements, LouhenFit coverage, and curated looks so every pair feels like it was made for your child.",
