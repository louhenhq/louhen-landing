# Contributing to Louhen Landing

Thanks for helping build Louhen üëü  
This guide explains the workflow, standards, and guardrails for contributing to **louhen-landing**.

## Quicklinks
- Locked decisions: [/CONTEXT/decision_log.md](CONTEXT/decision_log.md)
- Naming & structure: [/CONTEXT/naming.md](CONTEXT/naming.md)
- Migration map: [/CONTEXT/rename_map.md](CONTEXT/rename_map.md)
- Testing strategy: [/CONTEXT/testing.md](CONTEXT/testing.md)
- Performance budgets: [/CONTEXT/performance.md](CONTEXT/performance.md)
- Release process: [/CONTEXT/release.md](CONTEXT/release.md)

## 1) Read This First: /CONTEXT

Before any change, skim:
- /CONTEXT/agents.md ‚Äî how Codex should work (PLAN ‚Üí DIFF ‚Üí VALIDATE ‚Üí REVERT)
- /CONTEXT/coding_conventions.md ‚Äî style, structure, commits
- /CONTEXT/decision_log.md ‚Äî locked decisions (don‚Äôt break these)
- /CONTEXT/architecture.md ‚Äî routes, data flow, envs, CI/CD
- /CONTEXT/naming.md ‚Äî repo-wide naming, folders, routing, and selector spec

VS Code users: a pre-prompt in `.vscode/settings.json` already points Codex to these files.

Before you code, reaffirm the PLAN ‚Üí DIFF ‚Üí VALIDATE ‚Üí REVERT ritual and follow the one-feature-per-PR rule when renaming or moving files (see `/CONTEXT/rename_map.md` for planned moves).

---

## 2) Local Setup

Prereqs
- Node LTS (recommended: via nvm)
- npm
- A modern browser for local testing
- (If running E2E) Playwright browsers

Install
    npm ci

Run dev
    npm run dev

Run full checks before a PR
    npm run validate:local

---

## 3) Branching & PRs

- Create a feature/fix branch from `main` (e.g., `feat/waitlist-i18n`).
- Keep changes small and surgical (minimal diff).
- Every PR must include the **QA ‚Äî Validation Steps** block (auto-added by `.github/pull_request_template.md`).
- When moving files, use `git mv`, keep scope to one feature per PR, and update `/CONTEXT/rename_map.md` if the destination diverges from the plan.
- Run `npm run typecheck:build` before opening or updating a PR to ensure the production build config remains green.
- Prefer path aliases (`@components/...`, `@lib/...`, etc.) over deep relative imports as files migrate.
- When moving files, use `git mv`, keep scope to one feature per PR, and update `/CONTEXT/rename_map.md` if the destination diverges from the plan.

PR size & scope
- One logical change per PR.
- Avoid drive-by refactors; if a refactor is needed, split it into its own PR.

Screenshots
- For UI changes, add before/after screenshots or a short recording.

---

## 4) Commit Style (semantic-release)

Use Conventional Commits:
- feat(scope): add new capability
- fix(scope): address a bug
- chore(scope): tooling/maintenance
- docs(scope): documentation only
- refactor(scope): code change w/o behavior change
- test(scope): tests added/updated
- ci(scope): pipeline changes

Examples
- feat(waitlist): add server captcha verification
- fix(ci): upload lighthouse report artifact
- docs(context): add architecture overview

---

## 5) How to Work with Codex (AI) Effectively

Use the ritual below. It makes reviews faster and safer.

PLAN
    ‚â§8 steps, list files to touch, and rationale.

DIFF
    Unified diffs only for changed files. No unrelated formatting/import churn.

VALIDATE
    Exact commands to run, plus a short manual QA checklist.

REVERT
    Git commands to roll back if validation fails.

Renames must reference `/CONTEXT/rename_map.md`; update the table in the PR if plan deviates.

Guardrails
- Do not introduce new dependencies without a 1‚Äì2 bullet justification (why, footprint, alternatives).
- Do not change locked decisions (see /CONTEXT/decision_log.md).
- Never log secrets or PII. Redact emails in server logs (ma***@example.com).

---

## 6) Environment Variables

All secrets live in Vercel envs. Do **not** put secrets in the repo.

Required (see /CONTEXT/architecture.md):
- FIREBASE_ADMIN_SA_B64, FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_DB_REGION
- NEXT_PUBLIC_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY, HCAPTCHA_SECRET
- RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM, RESEND_REPLY_TO
- APP_BASE_URL, WAITLIST_CONFIRM_TTL_DAYS

Add guard clauses for missing envs (fail fast with clear, friendly errors).

---

## 7) Testing

- **Single entry point:** `npm run validate:local` mirrors CI (lint ‚Üí typecheck ‚Üí build ‚Üí production server ‚Üí unit ‚Üí Playwright e2e + axe ‚Üí Lighthouse) and writes reports to `artifacts/playwright/` and `artifacts/lighthouse/`. Run it before requesting review.
- **Playwright projects:** `desktop-chromium` runs everything by default; add `@mobile` to suites that must run on the `mobile-chromium` project, and use `@desktop-only` to opt out when behaviour diverges.
- **Targeted commands:**
  - `npm run test:e2e` ‚Äî full Playwright suite (desktop + tagged mobile).
  - `npm run test:axe` ‚Äî axe scans on the canonical desktop viewport.
  - `npm run lhci` ‚Äî Lighthouse CI thresholds (`/`, `/waitlist`, `/method`).
- Accessibility checks live in `tests/axe/canonical.axe.ts`; update the canonical matrix instead of creating new axe suites.
- **Negative paths:** Always cover at least one failing case for forms/APIs (invalid email, captcha failure, etc.).
- **Budgets:** Lighthouse thresholds stay Performance ‚â• 90, Accessibility ‚â• 95, SEO ‚â• 95, Best Practices ‚â• 95.
- **Guardrails:** Import `test`/`expect` from `@tests/fixtures/playwright`, prefer `data-testid` selectors, avoid `page.waitForTimeout`, intercept new third-party calls in the fixture, and mark unstable specs with `@quarantine` + a tracking issue. Lighthouse budgets live in `lighthouse-budgets.json`; raise limits only after sustained headroom (‚â•5 green runs).

---

## 8) Security & Privacy

- No client-side secrets.
- Minimal PII (email, locale, UTM, timestamps).
- Redact sensitive data in logs; never log tokens or raw headers containing PII.
- If you see a security concern, open a private issue or contact a maintainer directly.

---

## 9) Dependencies

Before adding a dependency, include in the PR:
- Why it‚Äôs needed (1‚Äì2 bullets)
- Size/maintenance considerations
- Alternatives considered

Remove unused deps when discovered.

---

## 10) Issue Templates

Use the GitHub templates:
- üêû Bug report
- ‚ú® Feature request

Blank issues are disabled; for questions, use Discussions (link in issue config).

---

## 11) Release & CI

- Every PR and push to `staging` runs the unified pipeline (policy guards ‚Üí build/test job mirroring `npm run validate:local`).
- Releases happen by promoting `staging` ‚Üí `production`; pushes to `production` run `semantic-release` to tag and update the changelog.
- Keep CI logs clean; fail fast on critical errors.

---

## 12) Ready-to-Use PR QA Block

Copy into your PR (already pre-filled by template):

VALIDATE
    npm ci
    npm run validate:local

Manual QA
- [ ] Load `/` ‚Üí no console errors
- [ ] Submit waitlist with valid email + captcha ‚Üí success UI, 200 response
- [ ] Invalid email ‚Üí inline error
- [ ] Missing/invalid captcha ‚Üí friendly error, no write
- [ ] Check `artifacts/lighthouse/summary.md` (scores & budgets) or rerun `npm run lhci` locally if needed

REVERT
    git revert <commit>
    # or restore file(s):
    git checkout -- <path>

---

## 13) Code of Conduct

Be kind, direct, and respectful. Assume good intent. We are building for parents and kids; quality and safety matter.
