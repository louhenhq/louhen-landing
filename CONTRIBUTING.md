# Contributing to Louhen Landing

Thanks for helping build Louhen üëü  
This guide explains the workflow, standards, and guardrails for contributing to **louhen-landing**.

> Always follow **PLAN ‚Üí DIFF ‚Üí VALIDATE** before requesting review.

---

## 1) Read This First: /CONTEXT

Before any change, skim:

- /CONTEXT/agents.md ‚Äî how Codex should work (PLAN ‚Üí DIFF ‚Üí VALIDATE ‚Üí REVERT)
- /CONTEXT/coding_conventions.md ‚Äî style, structure, commits
- /CONTEXT/decision_log.md ‚Äî locked decisions (don‚Äôt break these)
- /CONTEXT/architecture.md ‚Äî routes, data flow, envs, CI/CD

VS Code users: a pre-prompt in `.vscode/settings.json` already points Codex to these files.

---

## 2) Local Setup

Prereqs

- Node LTS (recommended: via nvm)
- npm
- A modern browser for local testing
- (If running E2E) Playwright browsers

Install
npm ci

Run dev
npm run dev

Run full checks before a PR
npm run validate:local

---

## 3) Branching & PRs

- Create a feature/fix branch from `main` (e.g., `feat/waitlist-i18n`).
- Keep changes small and surgical (minimal diff).
- Every PR must include the **QA ‚Äî Validation Steps** block (auto-added by `.github/pull_request_template.md`).

PR size & scope

- One logical change per PR.
- Avoid drive-by refactors; if a refactor is needed, split it into its own PR.

Screenshots

- For UI changes, add before/after screenshots or a short recording.

---

## 4) Commit Style (semantic-release)

Use Conventional Commits:

- feat(scope): add new capability
- fix(scope): address a bug
- chore(scope): tooling/maintenance
- docs(scope): documentation only
- refactor(scope): code change w/o behavior change
- test(scope): tests added/updated
- ci(scope): pipeline changes

Examples

- feat(waitlist): add server captcha verification
- fix(ci): upload lighthouse report artifact
- docs(context): add architecture overview

---

## 5) How to Work with Codex (AI) Effectively

Use the ritual below. It makes reviews faster and safer.

PLAN
‚â§8 steps, list files to touch, and rationale.

DIFF
Unified diffs only for changed files. No unrelated formatting/import churn.

VALIDATE
Exact commands to run, plus a short manual QA checklist.

REVERT
Git commands to roll back if validation fails.

Guardrails

- Do not introduce new dependencies without a 1‚Äì2 bullet justification (why, footprint, alternatives).
- Do not change locked decisions (see /CONTEXT/decision_log.md).
- Never log secrets or PII. Redact emails in server logs (ma\*\*\*@example.com).

---

## 6) Environment Variables

All secrets live in Vercel envs. Do **not** put secrets in the repo.

Required (see /CONTEXT/architecture.md):

- FIREBASE_ADMIN_SA_B64, FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_DB_REGION
- NEXT_PUBLIC_HCAPTCHA_SITE_KEY, HCAPTCHA_SECRET
- RESEND_API_KEY, RESEND_FROM, RESEND_REPLY_TO
- APP_BASE_URL, WAITLIST_CONFIRM_TTL_DAYS

Add guard clauses for missing envs (fail fast with clear, friendly errors).

---

## 7) Testing

Test matrix
npm run test:unit
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:axe
npm run lighthouse

Need a fresh CI run without pushing? Use the **Run Tests** workflow (Actions tab) or comment
`/test <suite>` on your PR. Suites: `unit`, `e2e`, `axe`, `lhci`, or `all`.

Accessibility & Perf budgets (Lighthouse `/waitlist`)
Performance ‚â• 90
Accessibility ‚â• 95
Best Practices ‚â• 95
SEO ‚â• 95

Warn-mode reminder

- a11y, SEO, and CSP checks run in warn mode until Phase 2; even when they warn, upload artifacts (axe, Lighthouse, CSP grep) to the PR.

Negative paths

- For forms/APIs, include at least one failing test (e.g., invalid email, captcha failure).

---

## 8) Security & Privacy

- No client-side secrets.
- Minimal PII (email, locale, UTM, timestamps).
- Redact sensitive data in logs; never log tokens or raw headers containing PII.
- If you see a security concern, open a private issue or contact a maintainer directly.

---

## 9) Dependencies

Before adding a dependency, include in the PR:

- Why it‚Äôs needed (1‚Äì2 bullets)
- Size/maintenance considerations
- Alternatives considered

Remove unused deps when discovered.

---

## 10) Issue Templates

Use the GitHub templates:

- üêû Bug report
- ‚ú® Feature request

Blank issues are disabled; for questions, use Discussions (link in issue config).

---

## 11) Release & CI

- Every PR runs: lint ‚Üí build ‚Üí tests (Playwright) ‚Üí Lighthouse (artifacts uploaded).
- Merges to `main` trigger `semantic-release` to tag and update CHANGELOG.
- Keep CI logs clean; fail fast on critical errors.

---

## 12) Ready-to-Use PR QA Block

Copy into your PR (already pre-filled by template):

VALIDATE
npm ci
npm run lint
npm run build
npx playwright test # optional if configured
npm run lhci

Manual QA

- [ ] Load `/` ‚Üí no console errors
- [ ] Submit waitlist with valid email + captcha ‚Üí success UI, 200 response
- [ ] Invalid email ‚Üí inline error
- [ ] Missing/invalid captcha ‚Üí friendly error, no write
- [ ] Lighthouse targets met on `/`

REVERT
git revert <commit> # or restore file(s):
git checkout -- <path>

---

## 13) Code of Conduct

Be kind, direct, and respectful. Assume good intent. We are building for parents and kids; quality and safety matter.
